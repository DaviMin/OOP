# Create a class to calculate the area of geometric shapes.
# The class should provide funkctionality for calculating area of a triangle using various formulas,
# the area of a rectangle, the area of square, the area of rhombus
# Class methods for calculating the area should be implemented with static methods. The calss should
# also count the number of calculations and return that value using a static method.
